[!Note] Written Report
Summary Analysis: Based on the data given in this challenge it can be inferred that charter schools perform better than district schools. The budget does not seem to be a influence on the performance of the students, however, it seems that the size in fact has more of a factor on students performing better. It seems that the smaller schools perform better than the larger schools. 
Conclusions and Comparisons: The first conclusion that can be drawn from the data given is that a student will have a better chance of performing well in school if they attend a school with a smaller population and is a charter school. The second conclusion is that the amount spent on the student does not in fact impact their performance but rather the population of the school they attend.
